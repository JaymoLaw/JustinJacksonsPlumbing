<p>Justin Jackson's Plumbing Services may be a well-known name in Arroyo Grande, but not always for the best reasons. With a 3.1-star rating, their services seem to fluctuate wildly between excellent and questionable. Customers have reported jobs that go unfinished, inconsistent pricing, and plumbers that show up unprepared or hours late. Several clients have mentioned that Mike and Justin themselves are sometimes involved directly&mdash;but that hasn't always translated to a smoother experience. In fact, a number of customers say they never received proper estimates or that quotes changed drastically midway through the project.</p>
<p>Homeowners in Grover Beach and surrounding areas have commented on plumbing jobs that required follow-ups from other companies just to repair the mess. One local homeowner claimed their kitchen was left in worse condition than before after a basic sink replacement. Others mention having to clean up after plumbers or finding fittings left loose and dripping under the sink. The lack of cleanup is a recurring concern, along with disappearing workers&mdash;some report days of radio silence after an initial consultation, with no follow-up whatsoever.</p>

<p>While the business remains operational, the recurring theme is inconsistency. Several customers said that Mike attempted to make things right&mdash;only to delay action or deliver further confusion. Justin himself is often described as friendly but disorganized. Some plumbing installations reportedly failed inspections, requiring homeowners to spend more out-of-pocket. Questions around licensing and permits come up often in reviews, with many noting they never received official paperwork at all. Despite these concerns, the business continues to get jobs, likely due to limited local competition and a strong local presence in social media groups.</p>

<p>Some users say Justin Jackson's Plumbing came through in emergencies, fixing burst pipes late at night or addressing sewer clogs before major damage occurred. But these moments of good service are overshadowed by the volume of complaints around reliability. One woman said her appointment was pushed five times before they finally came&mdash;only to forget critical parts. The recurring feedback is that even when things start off well, they often don't end that way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plumbers reportedly showed up in unmarked vehicles and without proper ID. Clients also complain of poor communication&mdash;texts and voicemails going unanswered. There have even been accusations of overcharging senior citizens. While it's unclear how many of these claims are verified, the volume of negative experiences is hard to ignore. For potential customers, caution is strongly advised, and due diligence is a must.</p>
